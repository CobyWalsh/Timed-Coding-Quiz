# Timed-Coding-Quiz

I created a timed quiz website, this website asks a series of five question. The website starts with the user entering thier name in the provided text box, after the user enters thier name they click the start button that will take them to the first question of the quiz. When the user selects the answer they click the submit button which will take them to the next question, the user continues this until they answer all five question. Once they are done they will be presented with a score. To reset the quiz the user can enter thier initials into the text box provided and then click the reset button taking them back to the beginning of the quiz where they will enter thier name and click the start button.
